G was interpreted as a prefix, so all G component values were wrong
This was found by checking the component objects against the net file

dB was not being calculated properly
was using abs() instead of real()
also was doing *10 for all, when should be *20 for non power variables

now only Re(Vout) and re(Av) for d_LPF_B750.csv are wrong
but very close e.g. model=-3.918e-09, user=-3.92e-09

Ext_mdB_a_Test_Circuit_1 did not produce multiple values for each variable
This was because the dict converter used in the input section overwrote duplicate values
So I added an optional mode used for the output block which adds to a list of units requested for each var
